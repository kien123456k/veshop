## How to run
- I built this application with Netbean 8.2 so maybe you can use Netbean IDE to make it more easily to import project.
- If you use other IDE such as Eclipse or Intellij IDEA, you will need to find the way to config this project before use.
- After import this project to IDE, adding JSTL support (almost all IDE support adding JSTL lib) and all external library in `Lib_jar_files`.
- Then, you will need to change `DBHelperExample.java` to `DBHelper.java` and replace database connection information to suit your need.

## Production
- You can use Heroku to deploy since it supports [deploy with war file](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/war-deployment).
